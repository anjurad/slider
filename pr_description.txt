Title: Style modal layout cleanup + CI workflow resilience\n\nSummary\nPolishes the Style modal experience by reorganizing the markup into responsive sections, adds matching layout primitives in CSS, and hardens CI workflows with explicit cache restores and manual dispatch support. Focus stays on UI structure and pipeline hygiene without altering underlying theme behavior.\n\nWhatâ€™s included\n- UI: Rebuild Style modal markup into columnar sections (App, Colors, Backgrounds, Overlay, Content Position, Fonts, Buttons, Outline, Config) using reusable grid/inline helpers.\n- CSS: Add grid/card utilities so the modal adapts cleanly from mobile to desktop breakpoints while inheriting themed colors.\n- Runtime: Preserve existing event wiring; preview paths still reference the same element IDs, just under new structural containers.\n- CI: Add lockfile diagnostics, explicit npm cache restore, and `workflow_dispatch` triggers for both `ci.yml` and `e2e.yml`.\n- Docs: Refresh internal Copilot instructions to reference `slider.html`.\n\nValidation (local)\n- Unit: PASS (`npm run test:unit`)\n- E2E: PASS (`npm run test:e2e`)\n\nNotes\n- Manual browser smoke test still recommended to confirm layout at narrow/wide widths and reduced-motion mode.\n- Follow-up: add updated screenshots in docs once UI validation is complete.\n\nChecklist\n- [x] UI restructuring\n- [x] CI workflow adjustments\n- [x] Tests green\n- [x] PR description\nEOF
