Title: Buttons: text color (auto/custom) + fill (solid/outline) — UI wiring, preset parity, tests\n\nSummary\nImplements configurable button styles and brings the Style UI + runtime in line with expectations. This branch is a clean rework off main with prior button commits cherry-picked and polished.\n\nWhat’s included\n- Feature: Button text color mode (auto/custom) with live preview.\n- Feature: Button fill mode (solid/outline) wired to computed CSS vars.\n- UI: Style modal updates — color input auto-enables on interaction; Save made reliably clickable after changes.\n- CSS: Preset active state matches overlay-position selected style (accent tint + inset highlight).\n- Runtime: Theme.applyConfig supports outline fill by making --btn-bg transparent; solid uses primary→accent gradient.\n- Tests: Unit coverage for button helpers; E2E for custom color + outline persistence; preset/overlay selection parity.\n\nValidation (local)\n- Unit: PASS (24 tests)\n- E2E (WebKit): PASS (69 passed, 1 skipped)\n\nNotes\n- Based on commits: aa07ad3, 3bf70c8, 47c600d, 5dc5cbb; adjusted CSS order/specificity for stability.\n- Non-functional: scrolled Save into view after fill changes to reduce flakiness in constrained viewports.\n\nChecklist\n- [x] Feature + UI wiring\n- [x] Runtime theming hooks\n- [x] Tests green\n- [x] PR description\n
