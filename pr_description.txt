Title: Rename app branding to Slider

Summary
Rename the entire project branding from “SlideApp” to “Slider”, covering UI strings, storage keys, sample content, and documentation.

What’s included
- UI: Update titles, placeholders, toast messages, demo decks, and SVG badges to display “Slider”.
- Storage: Rename localStorage/sessionStorage keys from `slideapp.*` to `slider.*` for persisted configs and deck restore.
- Docs & samples: Refresh README, markdown spec, external config docs, and sample decks to reference the new name and config filenames.
- Tests: Adjust Playwright suites and unit helpers to expect the updated branding and storage keys.

Validation (local)
- Unit: PASS (`npm run test:unit`)
- E2E: PASS (`npm run test:e2e`)

Notes
- Existing persisted configs under the old `slideapp.*` keys will not be migrated automatically.
