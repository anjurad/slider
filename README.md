# Slider

This repo contains a single-file HTML-based slide application and a Playwright test suite.

Refactor work-in-progress is tracked in `docs/refactor-plan.md`. The goal is to gradually modularize code while keeping tests green.

## Tests

- Run a single suite (fast):
  - `npm test`
- Run the full matrix:
  - `npm run test:all`
- Open test UI:
  - `npm run test:ui`
