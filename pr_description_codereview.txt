Title: Style modal layout cleanup + CI workflow resilience

Summary
Reorganizes the Style modal markup into semantically grouped sections, layers in responsive layout helpers, and updates CI workflows for better cache reuse and manual triggers. Aims to improve maintainability of the UI while keeping existing theming logic intact.

Changes
- HTML (`slider.html`): Replace flat flex rows with a two-column sectioned layout covering App, Colors, Backgrounds, Overlay, Content Position, Fonts, Buttons, Outline, and Config controls.
- CSS (`assets/app.css`): Add grid, card, and inline utility classes to drive the new layout while inheriting current theme variables.
- JS (`src/ui/styleModal.js`): Confirmed selectors/IDs remain consistent; no behavioral edits beyond structure awareness.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`): Enable `workflow_dispatch`, add explicit npm cache restore, and print lockfile diagnostics before installation.
- Docs (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`): Update references to the renamed `slider.html` entry file.

Validation
- Unit: PASS (`npm run test:unit`)
- E2E: PASS (`npm run test:e2e`)

Notes
- Manual browser verification across narrow and wide breakpoints plus reduced-motion mode is covered via Playwright smoke screenshots (`docs/images/style-modal-*.png`).
- External docs now embed updated Style modal screenshots captured after validation.
