Title: Rename app branding to Slider

Summary
Switch the project branding from “SlideApp” to “Slider” across the codebase, documentation, and tests.

Changes
- HTML/JS (`slider.html`, `src/ui/styleModal.js`): update default titles, placeholders, toast strings, and data attributes; change localStorage/sessionStorage keys to `slider.*`.
- Assets & content (`assets/preview.svg`, `content/welcome.md`, `sample_presentation.md`): swap textual references to the new name.
- Docs (`README.md`, `docs/external-config.md`, `docs/markdown-spec.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`): reflect the new brand and config filenames.
- Tests (`tests/*.spec.*`): align descriptions and storage-key expectations with the renamed app.

Validation
- Unit: PASS (`npm run test:unit`)
- E2E: PASS (`npm run test:e2e`)

Notes
- Users with persisted settings under `slideapp.*` keys will need to re-save, as the keys are renamed without migration.
